So, where to start?

First, you need to get the required assets for the game that you will be building. In this case, we just need one player gameObject at first. You can search for free online assets or the Unity Store as well which has got a rich list of free 2D and 3D assets.

Assets - [Unity Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/2d/characters?category=2d%2Fcharacters&price=0-0&orderBy=1)

Download the asset, and drag and drop to Unity Projects folder. A good idea is to arrange your folders in a structured manner. So, Having folders like 'Assets', 'Sound', 'Images', 'Scripts' etc. is always a good idea that helps in managing the structure in a uniform manner.

Once assets are loaded in Unity, we can try to create the movement for the player.
